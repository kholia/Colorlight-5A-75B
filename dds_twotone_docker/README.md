SSB is just FSK at a ridiculous baud rate. The more 'ridiculous' the speed, the
better the SSB quality ;)

In LLM words: 

In a traditional view, FSK is for "data" and SSB is for "analog voice," but
this trick proves they are the same thing on the wire if you switch fast
enough. You are "FSK-ing" between the components of the analytic signal so
rapidly that the physics of the narrow-band channel can't see the "seams" - it
only sees the resulting vector sum.

It's the ultimate engineering pivot:

* Standard approach: "I need a linear system to handle multiple frequencies."

* PE1NNZ / Your approach: "I'll just move so fast that the universe thinks I'm in two places at once."
